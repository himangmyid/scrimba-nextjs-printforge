# 🛠️ PrintForge — Next.js Practice Project from Scrimba

This is a hands-on project built as part of the [Scrimba Next.js course](https://scrimba.com/). In this course, I developed **PrintForge**, a website for exploring and sharing STL files for 3D printing.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Next.js** – for dynamic routing, static site generation, and server-side rendering  
- **TypeScript** – for safer and more structured code  
- **Tailwind CSS** – for fast and responsive styling  
- **NeoBrutalism UI** – a unique and modern neobrutalist user interface  

## 📦 Implemented Features

- Basic and dynamic routing  
- Async data fetching (server/client)  
- Layout and dynamic page components  
- Responsive and minimalist UI design
